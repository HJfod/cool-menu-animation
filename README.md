# Installation

1. Go to the latest release
2. Download menu.zip
3. Unzip in location of choice
4. Run OneTimeRunner.exe to try the mod out

## Note: OneTimeRunner.exe DOES NOT INSTALL the mod permanently in GD!

If you want to permanently install the mod, you need a modloader. MenuAnim has been tested with ModLdr and Mega Hack v6, although if you have both, there may be issues.

## About

This is a mod that makes your menu layer have a wacky animation every time you enter it.

...that's it.
