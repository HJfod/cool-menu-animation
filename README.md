# Installation

1. Go to the latest release
2. Download menu.zip
3. Unzip in location of choice
4. Run OneTimeRunner.exe to try the mod out

## Note: OneTimeRunner.exe DOES NOT INSTALL the mod permanently in GD!

If you want to permanently install the mod, you need a modloader. I don't know any, I want to make one myself, but such is not out yet. Ask your modloader provider for details on how to install.

## About

This is a mod that makes your menu layer have a wacky animation every time you enter it.

...that's it.

```None of the code for the mod is available here as I made it as a quick addition to BetterEdit, a mod I'm working on.```
